# üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide - Silver Oak University College Management System

> **Step-by-step guide to set up the system on your computer**

This guide will help you install and set up the College Management System on your computer. Don't worry if you're not technical - we'll explain everything in simple terms!

## üéØ What You'll Need

### Computer Requirements:
- **Windows 10/11, Mac, or Linux** computer
- **4GB RAM** minimum (8GB recommended)
- **5GB free disk space**
- **Internet connection** for downloading software

### Software You'll Install:
- **Node.js** - Runs the system (like installing an app)
- **MongoDB** - Stores all the data (like a digital filing cabinet)
- **Git** - Downloads the system files (optional)

## üöÄ Quick Start (For Non-Technical Users)

### Step 1: Download Required Software

#### Install Node.js:
1. **Go to**: https://nodejs.org/
2. **Download**: Click the "LTS" version (recommended)
3. **Run the installer**: Follow the installation wizard
4. **Restart your computer** after installation

#### Install MongoDB:
1. **Go to**: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
2. **Select**: Your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
3. **Download**: The community server version
4. **Run the installer**: Follow the installation wizard
5. **Start MongoDB**: It should start automatically

### Step 2: Get the System Files

#### Option A: Download ZIP (Easiest)
1. **Download** the system files as a ZIP folder
2. **Extract** the ZIP to a folder on your computer
3. **Remember** where you put the folder

#### Option B: Use Git (If you have it)
1. **Open** Command Prompt or Terminal
2. **Navigate** to where you want the files
3. **Run**: `git clone [repository-url]`

### Step 3: Install System Dependencies

1. **Open Command Prompt** (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux)
2. **Navigate** to the system folder:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/college-management-system
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   *This downloads all the required components (like installing app dependencies)*

### Step 4: Configure the System

1. **Create a file** called `.env` in the system folder
2. **Add these settings**:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/college_management
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-change-this
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-email-password
   ```

### Step 5: Set Up the Database

1. **Make sure MongoDB is running** (should start automatically)
2. **Run the database setup**:
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```
   *This creates sample data to test the system*

### Step 6: Start the System

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. **Open your browser**
3. **Go to**: http://localhost:3000
4. **You should see** the login page!
