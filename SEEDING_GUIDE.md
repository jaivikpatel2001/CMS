# 🌱 Database Setup Guide - Silver Oak University College Management System

> **Simple guide to populate your database with sample data**

## 🤔 What is Database Seeding?

Think of database seeding like **filling a new filing cabinet** with sample files. When you first install the system, the database is empty - like an empty filing cabinet. Seeding fills it with realistic sample data so you can test and demonstrate the system.

**Why do this?**
- **Test the system** with real-looking data
- **See how everything works** before adding real users
- **Demonstrate features** to others
- **Learn the system** without starting from scratch

## 🚀 How to Set Up Sample Data

### Method 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended)
```bash
npm run seed
```
*This is the easiest way - just run this command and everything happens automatically!*

### Method 2: Manual Setup
```bash
node seed.js
```
*This does the same thing as Method 1, just a different way to run it*

## 📊 What Sample Data Gets Created

The system creates realistic sample data including:

### 👥 **User Accounts (10 total)**
- **1 Administrator**: Full system control
- **4 Faculty Members**: Teachers with different subjects
- **5 Students**: Students with complete academic records

### 🎓 **Student Information (5 students)**
- **Enrollment Numbers**: C000001 to C000005
- **Program**: Diploma in IT (Year 3, Semester 5)
- **Subjects**: Web Technology, Java Programming, Mobile Technology, Python
- **Complete Profiles**: Contact info, addresses, emergency contacts

### 👨‍🏫 **Faculty Information (4 teachers)**
- **Employee IDs**: F001 to F004
- **Subjects**: Each teacher assigned to specific subjects
- **Experience**: Different levels of teaching experience
- **Contact Information**: Complete faculty profiles

### 📝 **Academic Data**
- **2 Assignments**: Real assignments with due dates
- **20 Grades**: Sample grades for all students in all subjects
- **160 Attendance Records**: 8 days of attendance for each student
- **4 Complaints**: Different types of student complaints
- **4 Announcements**: Sample college announcements

## 🔑 Test Login Credentials

After seeding, you can use these accounts to test the system:

### 👨‍💼 **Administrator Account**
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin123`
- **What you can do:** Everything - manage users, view statistics, handle complaints

### 👨‍🏫 **Faculty Account**
- **Username:** `faculty1`
- **Password:** `faculty123`
- **What you can do:** Manage students, grade assignments, mark attendance

### 👨‍🎓 **Student Account**

- **Password:** `student123`
- **What you can do:** View grades, submit assignments, check attendance

> **⚠️ Important:** These are test accounts! Change the passwords after installation for security.

## 🛠️ How to Customize the Sample Data

### Want Different Data? Here's How:

#### 1. **Add More Students**
Edit the `seed.js` file and look for the `createUsers()` function. Add more student entries like this:
```javascript
{
    username: 'student6',
    email: 'newstudent@silveroakuni.ac.in',
    password: 'student123',
    firstName: 'New',
    lastName: 'Student',
    role: 'student',
    phone: '9876543210'
}
```

#### 2. **Add More Faculty**
In the same function, add faculty entries:
```javascript
{
    username: 'faculty5',
    email: 'newteacher@silveroakuni.ac.in',
    password: 'faculty123',
    firstName: 'New',
    lastName: 'Teacher',
    role: 'faculty',
    phone: '9876543211'
}
```

#### 3. **Add More Assignments**
Find the `createAssignments()` function and add more assignments:
```javascript
{
    title: 'New Assignment',
    description: 'Assignment description',
    subjectCode: 'CS101',
    subjectName: 'Computer Science',
    dueDate: new Date('2024-02-15'),
    maxMarks: 100,
    instructions: 'Complete assignment instructions'
}
```

## 🔄 Re-running the Setup

### To Clear and Start Fresh:
```bash
npm run seed
```
*This clears all existing data and creates fresh sample data*

### To Add Data Without Clearing:
If you want to keep existing data and add more, you'll need to modify the `seed.js` file to skip the clearing step.

## ✅ Verification Checklist

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: "MongoDB Connection Error"
**Solution:**
- Make sure MongoDB is running on your computer
- Check that the connection string in `.env` file is correct
- Restart MongoDB if needed

### Problem: "Duplicate Key Errors"
**Solution:**

    // Create more test data
} else if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
    // Create minimal essential data only
}
```

### Selective Seeding
Seed only specific parts of the database:

```javascript
// Seed only users and students:
async function seedSpecific() {
    await createUsers();
    await createStudents();
    // Skip other collections
}
```
