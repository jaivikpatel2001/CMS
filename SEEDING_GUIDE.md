# üå± Database Setup Guide - Silver Oak University College Management System

> **Simple guide to populate your database with sample data**

## ü§î What is Database Seeding?

Think of database seeding like **filling a new filing cabinet** with sample files. When you first install the system, the database is empty - like an empty filing cabinet. Seeding fills it with realistic sample data so you can test and demonstrate the system.

**Why do this?**
- **Test the system** with real-looking data
- **See how everything works** before adding real users
- **Demonstrate features** to others
- **Learn the system** without starting from scratch

## üöÄ How to Set Up Sample Data

### Method 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended)
```bash
npm run seed
```
*This is the easiest way - just run this command and everything happens automatically!*

### Method 2: Manual Setup
```bash
node seed.js
```
*This does the same thing as Method 1, just a different way to run it*

## üìä What Sample Data Gets Created

The system creates realistic sample data including:

### üë• **User Accounts (10 total)**
- **1 Administrator**: Full system control
- **4 Faculty Members**: Teachers with different subjects
- **5 Students**: Students with complete academic records

### üéì **Student Information (5 students)**
- **Enrollment Numbers**: C000001 to C000005
- **Program**: Diploma in IT (Year 3, Semester 5)
- **Subjects**: Web Technology, Advanced Java Programming, Mobile Technology, Python Programming
- **Complete Profiles**: Contact info, addresses, emergency contacts

### üë®‚Äçüè´ **Faculty Information (4 teachers)**
- **Employee IDs**: F001 to F004
- **Subjects**: Each teacher assigned to specific subjects
- **Experience**: Different levels of teaching experience
- **Contact Information**: Complete faculty profiles

### üìù **Academic Data**
- **2 Assignments**: Real assignments with due dates
- **20 Grades**: Sample grades for all students in all subjects
- **160 Attendance Records**: 8 days of attendance for each student
- **4 Complaints**: Different types of student complaints
- **4 Announcements**: Sample college announcements

## üîë Test Login Credentials

After seeding, you can use these accounts to test the system:

### üë®‚Äçüíº **Administrator Account**
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin123`
- **What you can do:** Everything - manage users, view statistics, handle complaints

### üë®‚Äçüè´ **Faculty Account**
- **Username:** `faculty1`
- **Password:** `faculty123`
- **What you can do:** Manage students, grade assignments, mark attendance

### üë®‚Äçüéì **Student Account**
- **Username:** `student1`
- **Password:** `student123`
- **What you can do:** View grades, submit assignments, check attendance

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** These are test accounts! Change the passwords after installation for security.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Customize the Sample Data

### Want Different Data? Here's How:

#### 1. **Add More Students**
Edit the `seed.js` file and look for the `createUsers()` function. Add more student entries like this:
```javascript
{
    username: 'student6',
    email: 'new.student@silveroakuni.ac.in',
    password: 'student123',
    firstName: 'New',
    lastName: 'Student',
    role: 'student',
    phone: '9876543210'
}
```

#### 2. **Add More Faculty**
In the same function, add faculty entries:
```javascript
{
    username: 'faculty5',
    email: 'new.teacher@silveroakuni.ac.in',
    password: 'faculty123',
    firstName: 'New',
    lastName: 'Teacher',
    role: 'faculty',
    phone: '9876543211'
}
```

#### 3. **Add More Assignments**
Find the `createAssignments()` function and add more assignments:
```javascript
{
    title: 'New Assignment',
    description: 'Assignment description',
    subjectCode: 'CS101',
    subjectName: 'Computer Science',
    dueDate: new Date('2024-02-15'),
    maxMarks: 100,
    instructions: 'Complete assignment instructions'
}
```

## üîÑ Re-running the Setup

### To Clear and Start Fresh:
```bash
npm run seed
```
*This clears all existing data and creates fresh sample data*

### To Add Data Without Clearing:
If you want to keep existing data and add more, you'll need to modify the `seed.js` file to skip the clearing step.

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

After running the seed command, check these things:

- [ ] **Can log in** with test credentials
- [ ] **Students see** their grades and attendance
- [ ] **Faculty can view** assigned students
- [ ] **Assignments appear** in student dashboard
- [ ] **Complaints show up** in admin/faculty sections
- [ ] **Announcements display** correctly
- [ ] **All data relationships** work properly

## üêõ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: "MongoDB Connection Error"
**Solution:**
- Make sure MongoDB is running on your computer
- Check that the connection string in `.env` file is correct
- Restart MongoDB if needed

### Problem: "Duplicate Key Errors"
**Solution:**
- Run `npm run seed` again to clear and re-create data
- Check that you're not trying to create users with existing email addresses

### Problem: "Memory Issues"
**Solution:**
- Close other programs to free up memory
- Reduce the amount of data being created
- Process data in smaller batches

### Problem: "Validation Errors"
**Solution:**
- Check that all required fields are provided
- Make sure email addresses follow the correct format
- Verify that phone numbers are valid

## üìä Data Statistics After Seeding

When everything works correctly, you'll have:

| Data Type | Count | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Users** | 10 | All user accounts |
| **Students** | 5 | Student profiles with academic info |
| **Faculty** | 4 | Faculty profiles with subject assignments |
| **Assignments** | 2 | Sample assignments for students |
| **Grades** | 20 | Grades for all students in all subjects |
| **Attendance** | 160 | Attendance records (8 days √ó 5 students √ó 4 subjects) |
| **Complaints** | 4 | Different types of student complaints |
| **Announcements** | 4 | Sample college announcements |

## üéØ Benefits of Using Sample Data

### 1. **Realistic Testing**
- Test all features with real-looking data
- See how the system works with actual scenarios
- Verify that everything functions correctly

### 2. **Easy Demonstration**
- Show the system to others with populated data
- Demonstrate all features without starting from scratch
- Impress stakeholders with a working system

### 3. **Learning Tool**
- Understand how data flows through the system
- Learn the relationships between different data types
- Practice using all features

### 4. **Development Aid**
- Test new features with existing data
- Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
- Maintain consistent test environment

## üîß Advanced Options

### Environment-Specific Seeding
You can create different data for different environments:

```javascript
// In seed.js, add environment checks:
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
    // Create more test data
} else if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
    // Create minimal essential data only
}
```

### Selective Seeding
Seed only specific parts of the database:

```javascript
// Seed only users and students:
async function seedSpecific() {
    await createUsers();
    await createStudents();
    // Skip other collections
}
```

## üìû Need Help?

### If Something Goes Wrong:
1. **Check the error message** in the console
2. **Verify MongoDB is running**
3. **Check your `.env` file** settings
4. **Try running the command again**
